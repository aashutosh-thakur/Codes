# Bookstore Inventory:  As a bookstore manager, you create a list of book titles and their corresponding quantities in stock.
# Write a Python program that asks if the user is a manager or a normal user.
# Then allow the manager to create and update the list of books.
# Allow other users to search for a book title and check its availability.
# Prompt the user to enter a book title.
# If the book is in stock, display the quantity available; otherwise, show an appropriate message.
