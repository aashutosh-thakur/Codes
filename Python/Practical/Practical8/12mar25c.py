# You are working on a text manipulation tool that requires rotating words in a sentence. Implement a Python function rotate_sentence(sentence, n) that takes a sentence and an integer n as input and rotates each word in the sentence by n positions to the right. 
# Test case rotating "Hello World" by
# 1 position results in "World Hello".
def rotate_sentence(sentence, n):
    sentence.split()
    word=''
    words=''
    for i in range(n, len(sentence)):
        word.join()
    for j in range(n):
        words.join()
    print(word+words)
sentence=input("Enter the sentence: ")
n=int(input("Enter total rotation: "))
rotate_sentence(sentence, n)
